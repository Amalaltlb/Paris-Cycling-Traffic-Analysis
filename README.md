# Paris Cycling Traffic Analysis

## Introduction

In 2021, Paris introduced the **Plan VÃ©lo: Act 2** as part of its vision to become one of the most bike-friendly cities in Europe. Since then, the city has made significant investments in upgrading its cycling infrastructure to encourage more residents and tourists to use bicycles as a mode of transportation.

As part of this initiative, the city installed cyclist counting meters (hereon referred to as counters) on various streets and cycling paths. Our project aims to analyze the data collected by these counters and generate meaningful visualizations of traffic patterns. The findings will present actionable insights that city planners can use to further improve the cycling infrastructure in Paris.

## Data Sources

The two datasets used in this project were obtained from [opendata.paris.fr](https://opendata.paris.fr). Both datasets are publicly available:

- **Cycling Traffic Data**: Includes hourly counts of cyclists recorded by different bicycle counters across Paris. The dataset is 80MB in size and is updated daily. 
- **Street Address Data**: Contains detailed information about street addresses in Paris, used to classify counters by arrondissement.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to understand cycling traffic behavior in Paris and provide business insights that can support urban mobility decisions. Specifically, the analysis focuses on:

1. Identifying areas with the highest and lowest cycling traffic volumes and exploring cycling patterns in Paris.
2. Evaluating whether cycling-friendly initiatives for the **2024 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games** have impacted cycling as a means of transport in Paris.
3. Using **unsupervised machine learning models** to analyze the distribution of cycling traffic patterns.
4. Applying a **supervised machine learning model** to predict afternoon cyclist counts based on morning cyclist counts.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.
- **Power BI**: Visualization and dashboard creation for traffic insights.
