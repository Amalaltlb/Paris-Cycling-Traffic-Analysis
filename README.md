# Paris Cycling Traffic Analysis

## Introduction
In 2021, Paris launched **Plan Vélo: Act 2** to enhance its cycling infrastructure. This project analyzes data from cyclist counting meters to provide insights on traffic patterns, supporting urban mobility goals.

## Data Sources
- **Cycling Traffic Data**: Hourly cyclist counts across various streets.
- **Street Address Data**: Information about streets and arrondissements.

## Objectives
- Analyze traffic volumes across Paris.
- Assess the impact of Olympic initiatives on cycling.
- Apply clustering models to uncover traffic patterns.
- Use linear regression to predict afternoon cyclist counts.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data preprocessing and machine learning (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn).
- **Power BI**: Interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Key Visualizations
- **Heatmap**: Cyclist concentration across arrondissements.
- **Traffic Pattern Visualization**: Daily cycling patterns and peak hours.

## Future Work
- Integrate external factors like weather for better predictions.
- Explore advanced machine learning models for traffic forecasting.

## Conclusion
This co-project, developed in collaboration with my colleages in data analyst course, provides valuable insights to improve Paris’s cycling infrastructure, contributing to a more sustainable and bike-friendly city.
